  Feel free to check our other parts of the website, too! I'm currently working on adding more content, in the form of additional projects, a blog, and a home page revamp. So there's more to look forward to. :)

### Me

Hi, I'm Ajay.

I am from New Delhi, India. Though, I completed a Bachelor of Technology degree from Maharshi Dayanand University, India.

I'm also <em>really</em> into indie rock, creative writing, travelling, and caffeine. I cycle between other hobbies as well, with the change of seasons.

Python  • R • Java • Javascript • HTML • CSS • MySQL • MongoDB • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Pandas • Numpy

for use with concepts such as:

Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Analytics, Statistical Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, Database Systems & Information Modelling • Software Engineering • Web Application Development, <em>and more!</em>

Thankfully, I'm not a cat.


Check out my [portfolio](/portfolio) to see iPython notebooks and Github repos for some of the projects I've worked on.
